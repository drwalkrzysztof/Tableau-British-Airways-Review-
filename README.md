# Tableau British Airways Review 

This is my very first  interactive dashboard which allows to toggle in between visualisations showing: parameters with a measures, calculated fields, filters and groups category 


# Problem statement 

This dashbord helps the airliness understand their customers better. It helps the airliness know if customers are satified with their service. Through different rating they get to know their improvment areas and thus they can provide a better service. Once the prolblems are identified they can further work on factors triggering the unwanted experience. 


# Step followed:
1. Loading the data into Tabeau Desktop, the data set is a csv file. 
2. create a new relationship between the files. 
3. Create an average custom metric by country (map, custom parameter, calculated field, advanced filters).
4 Create an average custom metric by month (line chart).
5. Create average custom metric by aircraft (double bar chart).
6. Create and format a dashboard (linking all elements).
